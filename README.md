To connect a photoresistor to an Arduino Uno, you will need to connect it to one of the board's analog input pins.
The exact pin that you use will depend on your specific circuit and the pinout of the photoresistor.

Connect one end of a 10KÎ© resistor to the photoresistor.
Connect the other end of the resistor to the GND pin on the Arduino Uno.
Connect the middle leg of the photoresistor to the A0 pin on the Arduino Uno.
This creates a voltage divider circuit that allows the Arduino to measure the resistance of the photoresistor. 
The resistance will change depending on the amount of light that the photoresistor is exposed to.
It is important to notice that different photoresistor may have different specifications, and you may need to adjust the value of the resistor accordingly, 
to have a correct reading of the photoresistor. Also, you may need to adjust the code to match the pin number and the resistance value of the resistor.
It is always a good practice to double check the wiring and the pinout of the photoresistor before uploading any code to the arduino board.
